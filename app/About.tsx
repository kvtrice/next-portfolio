						I'm a Junior Software Engineer with over 7 years of
						experience in the tech industry. Most recently I've
						worked as a Product Manager in B2B SaaS companies, where
						I spent over 4 years collaborating closely with
						development teams to drive strategic initiatives and
						product launches.
						<br />
						<br />
						A pivotal moment in my career was participating in a
						startup accelerator program. This experience, where I
						quickly built and launched a mobile app using low-code
						tools, inspired me to formally retrain as a Software
						Engineer.
						<br />
						<br />
						I completed a 6-month coding bootcamp, earning a Diploma
						of IT, and joined _nology, a program renowned for its
						commitment to diversity. I'm also currently completing a
						Bachelor of Computer Science as I continue to grow my
						skills.
						<br />
						<br />
						With a strong foundation in full-stack development and a
						focus on frontend technologies, my skills include React, Next.js,
						JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Express, SQL, HTML, and CSS. I thrive on creating
						intuitive user experiences and bringing solutions
						to life that make an impact. âœ¨
