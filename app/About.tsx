						I'm a Product Manager with nearly 8 years of experience
						in the tech industry, including 4+ years as a PM
						delivering impactful solutions in B2B SaaS companies. My
						career is driven by a passion for improving users'
						lives, combining empathy, strategic thinking, and
						innovative problem-solving.
						<br />
						<br />
						A recent chapter of my journey involved hands-on
						technical experience in full-stack development, where I
						enhanced my ability to connect user needs, business
						goals, and technical feasibility. This unique blend of
						skills enables me to deliver user-focused solutions that
						resonate with customers.
						<br />
						<br />
						I bring a strong foundation in product strategy, user
						research, and intuitive UX design, complemented by
						technical proficiency in React, Next.js,
						JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Express, SQL, HTML, and
						CSS. This combination allows me to bridge the gap
						between product and engineering, ensuring we arrive at
						the best solution for the ideal customer outcome.
						<br />
						<br />I thrive on creating meaningful solutions that
						empower users and make a difference, working at the
						intersection of strategy, design, and technology to
						bring big ideas to life. âœ¨
