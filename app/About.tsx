						Hey I'm Kat ðŸ‘‹ A frontend-leaning Software Engineer
						passionate about building intuitive, user-first
						interfaces that make technology feel effortless.
						<br />
						<br />
						I started in tech through product and design, and that
						background still shapes how I approach development
						today: clear thinking, user-first decisions, and a love
						of clean, considered interfaces. I've worked on
						AI-powered journaling apps, knowledge-sharing tools,
						dashboards, e-commerce prototypes, and more â€” always
						with an eye on making tech more accessible, intuitive,
						and human.
						<br />
						<br />
						Right now, I'm building frontend experiences at Aurecon,
						where I help turn generative AI into useful, usable
						products for real people. I'm particularly passionate
						about working in cross-functional teams, translating
						ideas into code, and constantly learning new ways to
						solve real problems.
						<br />
						<br />
						Outside of work, you'll usually find me reading, walking
						my dog, playing board games with my family or finding
						some outdoor walks or hikes to explore ðŸ¥¾
