            Hey I'm Kat ðŸ‘‹ A technology professional with a background that
            spans software engineering, product management, and customer
            experience. I love making complex things feel simple - whether
            that's through an intuitive interface, a clear onboarding flow, or
            thoughtful documentation that really supports users.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've worked across enterprise tools, early-stage startups and B2B
            SaaS platforms where I've led international product launches,
            onboarded early customers, and built experiences that delight and
            engage users.
            <br />
            <br />
            Right now at Aurecon, I'm helping design and build tools that make
            work easier for teams by bringing generative AI into their everyday
            workflows.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work you'll usually find me reading, walking my dog,
            playing board games with my family, or finding some outdoor trails
            to explore ðŸ¥¾
