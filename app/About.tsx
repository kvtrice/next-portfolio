						Hey I'm Kat, a Software Engineer with a strong
						foundation in Product Management and a passion for
						building impactful, user-focused solutions.
						<br />
						<br />
						After 8 years in tech, including 4+ years as a PM in B2B
						SaaS, I transitioned into software engineering to deepen
						my technical expertise and contribute more directly to
						building great products.
						<br />
						<br />
						My journey began when I built and launched a low-code
						mobile app through a startup accelerator program,
						followed by upskilling via intensive bootcamps and
						working hands-on with full-stack technologies.
						<br />
						<br /> Now, I bring a unique blend of technical skills,
						product thinking, and customer obsession to everything I
						build. With an ability to bridge the gap between
						engineering and product, I thrive in solving complex
						problems and creating software that delivers real
						impact âœ¨
