						Hey I'm Kat ðŸ‘‹ A Junior Software Engineer passionate
						about building intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that
						make technology feel effortless. With a background in UX
						/ UI Design and Product Management, I bring a user-first
						mindset to frontend development, ensuring what I build
						isn't just functional - it truly resonates with users.
						<br />
						<br />
						I started in software engineering as a co-founder and
						low-code developer, launching Talk to Maple, an
						AI-powered self-care mobile app. That experience sparked
						my love for coding and crafting great user experiences,
						leading me to earn a Diploma of IT with Coder Academy,
						where I honed my skills in JavaScript, React, and UI
						development.
						<br />
						<br />
						Since then, I've grown my experience through a software
						engineering internship, immersive training with _nology,
						and now my role at Aurecon, where I help embed
						generative AI into intuitive applications - creating
						seamless, accessible, and engaging AI-powered
						experiences. I thrive on collaboration, problem-solving,
						continuous learning and translating complex challenges
						into elegant products that make a real impact.
