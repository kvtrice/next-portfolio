				<h3>Make journaling an engaging experience</h3>
				<br />
				<p>
					Journaling is widely accepted as a best practice tool to
					support mental health, however from our own experiences
					we've seen that many people simply don't do it. So we went
					on a mission to create a more fun and engaging experience,
					particularly for Gen-Z, the generation most in need of
					mental health support (with 1 in 5 impacted worldwide
					annually).
					<br />
					<br />I led product, design and front-end development and
					the other full time co-founder led go-to-market, commercials
					and back-end development. The third co-founder was part time
					(1-2 days a week), supporting the A.I. integration, prompt
					engineering and data science.
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h2 className="sub-heading">The Goal</h2>
				<p>
					Our goal was to launch an app that included a journalling
					experience that users enjoyed and they wanted to keep coming
					back to (demand and engagement). We also wanted to prove
					that our journaling experience had a positive impact on the
					user, and that no harm was done.
				</p>
				<br />
				<br />
				<h2 className="sub-heading">Scope and Constraints</h2>
				<p>
					There were a number of constraints around this project.
					Being a VC program, we had an extremely short timeline with
					milestones we had to hit throughout to progress to the next
					phase. This meant at times we were making trade-offs between
					user needs and potential investor expectations.
					<br />
					<br />
					We also had no coding experience, so we decided to launch
					our app using a low-code platform. There was a steep
					learning curve and limitations to what we could achieve that
					had to be factored into the product and design decisions.
					<br />
					<br />
					We additionally had extremely limited budget, with any
					expense being out of pocket. Given this, we weren't able to
					outsource aspects of the project and ultimately kept costs
					low by doing / learning everything ourselves.
