					Talk to Maple is a startup founded by myself and 2 other
					co-founders, with our idea being accepted into Antlerâ€™s VC
					pre-launch program in January 2023. This program offers
					promising founders the opportunity to build their companies
					and raise $200K in pre-seed funding. As a co-founding team
					we built and launched a B2C app helping young people improve
					their mental health through building better self care
					habits, via the power of A.I. journaling and gamification.
